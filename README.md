# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-Term-Project
Driver Drowsiness Detection project with Python

## Marmara University - Computer Engineering Term Project
**Developed by Mustafa Abdullah HAKKOZ, Ayşenur YILMAZ, Mahmut AKTAŞ.** (Note: this is an ongoing project that is still under development)

Development of a robust and practical drowsiness detection system is a crucial step. This project aims to make a system that detects the driver’s drowsiness status based on their facial behaviors.  
In this project, we will design a system that checks a driver’s facial behaviour, mainly eyes and mouth, in real-time to be able to detect drowsiness status of the driver. In order to achieve this goal, firstly we will detect the driver’s face and extract the facial features. After extracting these features, we will train a model with drowsy non-drowsy test data. By using this model the application will decide if the driver is drowsy or not.
