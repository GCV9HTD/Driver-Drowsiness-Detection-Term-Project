# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-Term-Project
Driver Drowsiness Detection project with Python

## Marmara University - Computer Engineering Term Project
**Developed by Mustafa Abdullah HAKKOZ, Ayşenur YILMAZ, Mahmut AKTAŞ.** (Note: this is an ongoing project that is still under development)

Development of a robust and practical drowsiness detection system is a crucial step. This project aims to make a system that detects the driver’s drowsiness status based on their facial behaviors.
